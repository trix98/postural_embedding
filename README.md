# postural_embedding
CNN transfer learning to investigate stereotyped postures in Drosophila melanogaster. 3rd project for my MSc in Bioinformatics and Theoretical Systems Biology at Imperial College London.

The focus of this project was to investigate if CNN transfer learning, specifically VGG19 trained on ImageNET, can extract deep features encoding postural information from image data of freely moving ground-based D. melanogaster under controlled conditions.

To investigate if the VGG19 extracted features encoded posture we performed clustering analysis using HDBSCAN on a low dimensional embedding. This was to assess if the resultant clusters correspond to characteristic postural 
phenotypes indicating encoded postural information.
